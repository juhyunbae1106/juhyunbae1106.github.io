  + Selected Students' Comments: 
    - Juhyun was helpful in directing me back to certain lectures when I struggled with a particular concept. She also provided encouragement and positive critique if I was off-track or not quite catching an item.
  
    - This is the best TA I have ever had. The TA was available to help me whenever I needed anything. She knew
how to breakdown complex concepts and make it easier for me to understand.
  
    - The TA was very good at helping convey where to go when I was struggling with some of the concepts in the
homework, providing great feedback on if I was close to the mark or not. Also they were very quick to reply to
emails about homework, even on the weekend with I cannot thank them enough for.
