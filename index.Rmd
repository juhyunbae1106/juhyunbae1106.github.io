I am a doctoral candidate at the University of Missouri <a href = "https://truman.missouri.edu" target="_blank">Harry S Truman School of Government and Public Affairs</a>. 

My research interest lies in welfare states and social welfare policy, particularly I have a deep interest in increasing labor market inequality and policy solutions to reduce this inequality. My research seeks to understand how to redesign the social security system to protect the job security of newly precarious non-standard workers, especially app-based gig workers as my Ph.D. dissertation.

I obtained Bachelor's degree in Public Administration in 2016 and a Master's degree in <a href = "https://yupa.yonsei.ac.kr/yupa_en/index.do" target="_blank"> Public Administration from Yonsei University</a> (South Korea) in 2018. Prior to starting my doctoral degree, I worked in the  <a href = "https://eng.kwdi.re.kr/" target="_blank"> KWDI(Korean Womenâ€™s Development Institute)</a> as a project researcher.

My full CV is available <a href = "files/CV_JB_202306_vers.pdf" target="_blank">here</a>
