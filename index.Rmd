Hi, I am an assistant professor in <a href = "https://www.utrgv.edu/political-science/" target="_blank"> the Department of Political Science at the University of Texas - Rio Grande Valley (UTRGV)</a>. I hold a Ph.D. in Public Affairs from <a href = "https://truman.missouri.edu/" target="_blank"> the Truman School of Government and Public Affairs at the University of Missouri</a>. 

My research interest lies in welfare states, social welfare policy, and public opinion, particularly I have a deep interest in increasing labor market inequality and policy solutions to reduce this inequality. My research seeks to understand how to redesign the social security system to protect the job security of newly precarious non-standard workers, especially app-based gig workers as my Ph.D. dissertation.

I obtained Bachelor's degree in Public Administration in 2016 and a Master's degree in <a href = "https://yupa.yonsei.ac.kr/yupa_en/index.do" target="_blank"> Public Administration from Yonsei University</a> (South Korea) in 2018. Prior to starting my doctoral degree, I worked in the  <a href = "https://eng.kwdi.re.kr/" target="_blank"> KWDI(Korean Womenâ€™s Development Institute)</a> as a project researcher.

My full CV is available <a href = "files/CV_JB_Final.pdf" target="_blank">here</a>
